This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

Run `bun run setup` to package the bundle and use it for the example.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
bun start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

Run:

```sh
bun run android
```

### iOS

Run:

```sh
bun run ios
```

If you get an error, you may need to have the simulator be open/running first.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

If you modifiy the javascript / typescript files the app should automatically reload otherwise you can press `r` in the terminal.
If you update the root/package src files you will need to run `bun run setup` to update the local react-native-onesignal package.
And if you modify things like java or c code, you will need to run `bun run android` or `bun run ios` again.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
