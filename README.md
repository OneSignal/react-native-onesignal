## Note Regarding 0.39 <= React Native >= 0.40 Support

For React Native >= 0.40, use version 3+.
For React Native <= 0.39, use version 2+.

## Running Example project

For your convenience, we created an example project, based on React Native 0.36.1.
You can run this project to test configurations, debug, and build upon it.

 * `git clone https://github.com/geektimecoil/react-native-onesignal`
 * `cd react-native-onesignal && cd examples && cd OneSignalRNExample`
 * `npm install && cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
 * Running the iOS example app: `react-native run-ios`
 * Running the Android example app: `react-native run-android`

## Installation
`npm install --save react-native-onesignal`

## Automatic Linking
`react-native link react-native-onesignal`

## Android Installation

* Follow OneSignal's instructions on generating a Google Server API Key: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key

### Adding the Code

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
.....

<!-- Optional - Add the necessary permissions (Choose one of those) -->

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/> <!-- Approximate location - If you want to use promptLocation for letting OneSignal know the user location. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/> <!--  Precise location If you want to use promptLocation for letting OneSignal know the user location. -->

<!-- End optional permissions -->

<application ....>
    <activity
        android:launchMode="singleTop"> <!-- Add this parameter -->
    .....
```

In `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
````javascript
...

distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
```

In `android/build.gradle`
```gradle
...

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.2' // Upgrade gradle

    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
}
```

In `android/app/build.gradle`

```gradle
...

android {
    ...
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.2" // NOT REQUIRED BUT RECOMMENDED - This is good for in-process dex (faster)
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        manifestPlaceholders = [onesignal_app_id: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_ID",
                                onesignal_google_project_number: "REMOTE"]
    }
}
```

## iOS Installation
 * Open OneSignal account here: https://onesignal.com/
 * Follow OneSignal's instructions on generating an iOS Push Certificate: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-an-ios-push-certificate

### With CocoaPods
 * If you haven't done so, initialize CocoaPods:
     * `cd ios`
     * `sudo gem install cocoapods`
     * `pod setup`
     * `pod init`

 * Install the OneSignal Pod
     * `open -a Xcode Podfile`
     * Add the following line: `pod 'OneSignal'` inside the `target 'YourProject' do` block.
     * Remove the `target 'YourProjectTests' do` block entirely from your podfile.
     * `pod install`
 * Once you've finished, Open your workspace in Xcode.

### Without CocoaPods
  If your dont want to use cocoapods add in the `Framework Search Paths` the following line before build the project:
  `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-onesignal` set to `recursive`.

  And add to your project the OneSignal.framework which is on YOUR_PROJECT/node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/frameworks/OneSignal.framework

### Adding the Code

Make sure that on your target `Header Search Paths`, you have the following line after linking the project:
`$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/RCTOneSignal` set to `non-recursive`.

And add in the `Framework Search Paths` the following line before build the project:
`$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-onesignal`

When you reach the `AppDelegate.m` instructions on the OneSignal documentation, stop and do the following instead:

 * in `AppDelegate.h`:
   * Import `RCTOneSignal.h`:

       ```objc
       #import <RCTOneSignal.h>
       ```

   * Declare the `RCTOneSignal` property:

       ```objc
       @property (strong, nonatomic) RCTOneSignal* oneSignal;
       ```

 * in `AppDelegate.m`:

    * Synthesize `oneSignal` after `@implementation AppDelegate`

        ```objc
        @synthesize oneSignal = _oneSignal;
        ```

    * On the `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, insert the following code (replace YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID with your OneSignal app ID):

        ```objc
        self.oneSignal = [[RCTOneSignal alloc] initWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions
                                                               appId:@"YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID"];
        ```

    * After `application ` insert the code for the notification event:

        ```objc
        // Required for the notification event.
        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification {
            [RCTOneSignal didReceiveRemoteNotification:notification];
        }
        ```

 * You're All Set!


## Android Usage

In your `index.android.js`:
```javascript
import OneSignal from 'react-native-onesignal'; // Import package from node modules
// var _navigator; // If applicable, declare a variable for accessing your navigator object to handle payload.

OneSignal.configure({
	onIdsAvailable: function(device) {
		console.log('UserId = ', device.userId);
		console.log('PushToken = ', device.pushToken);
	},
  onNotificationReceived: function(notification) {
    console.log("notification received: ", notification);
  },
  onNotificationOpened: function(openResult) {
      console.log('MESSAGE: ', openResult.notification.payload.body);
      console.log('DATA: ', openResult.notification.payload.additionalData);
      console.log('ISACTIVE: ', openResult.notification.isAppInFocus);
      console.log('openResult: ', openResult);
      // Do whatever you want with the objects here
      // _navigator.to('main.post', data.title, { // If applicable
      //  article: {
      //    title: openResult.notification.payload.body,
      //    link: openResult.notification.payload.launchURL,
      //    action: data.openResult.notification.action.actionSelected
      //  }
      // });
  }
});
```

## iOS Usage

In iOS, we have to wait a little bit before fetching the notification. The reason is that notification is coming too fast, before the main view of the app is being rendered.
Therefore, the notification could get lost. We solve it in an ugly way, but working one.

In your `index.ios.js`:
```javascript
import OneSignal from 'react-native-onesignal'; // Import package from node modules

var pendingNotifications = [];
// var _navigator; // If applicable, declare a variable for accessing your navigator object to handle payload.
// function handleNotificationAction (openResult) { // If you want to handle the notification with a payload.
    // _navigator.to('main.post', openResult.notification.payload.title, {
    //  article: {
    //    title: openResult.notification.payload.title,
    //    link: openResult.notification.payload.launchURL,
    //    action: openResult.notification.action.actionSelected
    //  }
    //});
// }

OneSignal.configure({
	onIdsAvailable: function(device) {
		console.log('UserId = ', device.userId);
		console.log('PushToken = ', device.pushToken);
	},
  onNotificationReceived: function(notification) {
      console.log('NOTIFICATION RECEIVED: ', notification);
  },
  onNotificationOpened: function(openResult) {
      console.log('NOTIFICATION OPENED: ', openResult);
      //if (!_navigator) { // Check if there is a navigator object. If not, waiting with the notification.
      //    console.log('Navigator is null, adding notification to pending list...');
          pendingNotifications.push(notification);
      //    return;
      // }
      handleNotificationAction(openResult);
  }
});
```

## API

### Handling Notifications
When any notification is opened or received the callback `onNotificationOpened` or `onNotificationReceived` is called passing an OSNotificationOpenResult or an OSNOtification object encapsulating the event data.

Notification object received example:
```javascript
{
    shown: true, // BOOLEAN: If the notification was displayed to the user or not
    payload: {notificationID : "", contentAvailable : false, badge : 1, sound : "default", title : "Hello!", body : "World", launchURL : "", }, // OBJECT; the push data
    displayType: 1, //The display method of a received notification
    silentNotification: false // BOOLEAN : Wether the received notification was a silent one
}
```

### Sending and Getting OneSignal Tags

We exposed the tags API of OneSignal to allow you to target users with notification later.

````javascript
// Sending single tag
OneSignal.sendTag("key", "value");

// Sending multiple tags
OneSignal.sendTags({key: "value", key2: "value2"});

// Getting the tags from the server and use the received object
OneSignal.getTags((receivedTags) => {
    console.log(receivedTags);
});

// Delete a tag
OneSignal.deleteTag("key");
````

### Getting Player ID and Push Token

We exposed the idsAvailable API of OneSignal (both Android & iOS) as an event.
Just define a onIdsAvailable callback in the configure options.

````javascript
// Getting idsAvailable
OneSignal.configure({
	onIdsAvailable: function(device) {
		console.log('UserId = ', device.userId);
		console.log('PushToken = ', device.pushToken);
	}
});
````

### Enable Vibration

We exposed the enableVibrate API of OneSignal (Android only).

*You can call this from your UI from a button press for example to give your user's options for your notifications. By default OneSignal always vibrates the device when a notification is displayed unless the device is in a total silent mode. Passing false means that the device will only vibrate lightly when the device is in it's vibrate only mode.*

````javascript
// Setting enableVibrate
OneSignal.enableVibrate(true);
````

### Enable Sound

We exposed the enableSound API of OneSignal (Android only).

*You can call this from your UI from a button press for example to give your user's options for your notifications. By default OneSignal plays the system's default notification sound when the device's notification system volume is turned on. Passing false means that the device will only vibrate unless the device is set to a total silent mode.*

````javascript
// Setting enableSound
OneSignal.enableSound(true);
````

### Set In App Focus Behavior

We exposed the inFocusDisplaying API of OneSignal (Android only).

 - `0` = `None`         - Will not display a notification, instead only `onNotificationReceived` will fire where you can display your own in app messages.
 - `1` = `InAppAlert`   - *(Default)* Will display an Android AlertDialog with the message contains.
 - `2` = `Notification` - Notification will display in the Notification Shade. Same as when the app is not in focus.

````javascript
// Example, always display notification in shade.
OneSignal.inFocusDisplaying(2);
````

### Change User Subscription Status

We exposed the setSubscription API of OneSignal (both Android & iOS).

*You can call this method with false to opt users out of receiving all notifications through OneSignal. You can pass true later to opt users back into notifications*

````javascript
// Setting setSubscription
OneSignal.setSubscription(true);
````

### Post Notification (Peer-to-Peer Notifications)

We exposed the postNotification API of OneSignal, currently supports one Player ID to send a notification to.
We call it internally P2P Notification, and therefore there is a special attribute to listen to while receiving the notification.

*Allows you to send notifications from user to user or schedule ones in the future to be delivered to the current device.*

The [OneSignal documentation](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-native-sdk#section--postnotification-) shows how to pass the [parameters](https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference#create-notification) as here:

````javascript
// Calling postNotification
let data = arr // some array as payload
let contents = {
	'en': 'You got notification from user'
}
OneSignal.postNotification(contents, data, playerId);

// Listening to postNotification using OneSignal.Configure:
onNotificationOpened: function(message, data, isActive) {
	if (data.p2p_notification) {
		for (var num in data.p2p_notification) {
			// console.log(data.p2p_notification[num]);
		}
	}
}
````

### Prompt Location

We exposed the promptLocation API of OneSignal.

*Prompts the user for location permissions. This allows for geotagging so you can send notifications to users based on location.
Note: Make sure you also have the required location permission in your AndroidManifest.xml. For iOS, make sure you set the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription in your info.plist. (Location Always also requires the location background mode capability)*

````javascript
// Calling promptLocation
OneSignal.promptLocation();
````

### Clear Notifications (Android Only)

We exposed the clearOneSignalNotifications API of OneSignal (currently supported only on Android).

*Removes all OneSignal notifications from the Notification Shade.*

````javascript
// Calling clearOneSignalNotifications
OneSignal.clearOneSignalNotifications();
````

### Cancel Notifications (Android Only)

We exposed the cancelNotification API of OneSignal (currently supported only on Android).

*Cancels a single OneSignal notification based on its Android notification integer id. You can get the notification Id when invoking OneSignal.onNotificationOpened while receiving a notification.*

````javascript
// Calling cancelNotification
OneSignal.cancelNotification(id);
````

### Check Push Notification Permissions (iOS Only)

See what push permissions are currently enabled. callback will be invoked with a permissions object (currently supported only on iOS).

````javascript
// Requesting permissions
OneSignal.checkPermissions((permissions) => {
	console.log(permissions);
});
````

### Request Push Notification Permissions (iOS Only)

We exposed the requestPermissions method (currently supported only on iOS).

````javascript
// Setting requestPermissions
permissions = {
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true
};
OneSignal.requestPermissions(permissions);
````

### Register For Push Notifications (iOS Only)

We exposed the registerForPushNotifications API of OneSignal (currently supported only on iOS).

*Call when you want to prompt the user to accept push notifications. Only call once and only if you passed false to **initWithLaunchOptions autoRegister**:.*

````javascript
// Calling registerForPushNotifications
OneSignal.registerForPushNotifications();
````

The following example is from our own App and needs to be customized in order to work.

Example:
```javascript
_syncOneSignal = () => {
	var allTags = {};
	var missingTags = {};

	OneSignal.getTags((receivedTags) => {
		// Find missing tags
		for (var i = this.categories.length * 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			var category = this.categories[i];
			if (!(category.slug in receivedTags)) {
				missingTags[category.slug] = category.is_push_default;
			}
			// Hash all tags for performance later on deletion
			allTags[category.slug] = category.is_push_default;
		};

		// Send missing tags if there are any
		if (Object.keys(missingTags).length > 0) {
			OneSignal.sendTags(missingTags);
		}

		// Delete tags that doesn't show up in the categories
		Object.keys(receivedTags).forEach(function(key,index) {
		    if (!(key in allTags)) {
		    	OneSignal.deleteTag(key);
		    }
		});
	});
};
```

## FAQ / Repeating Issues
The following issues has been marked as repeating, therefore we decided to devote them a separate section.

### Issue 1 - Multiple dex files define:
```gradle
> com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/android/gms/internal/zzr;
```

Solution: Update all your Google Play Services dependencies to the latest version rather than to a specific version.

From the Google Play Services documentation:
*Be sure you update this version number each time Google Play services is updated https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup#add_google_play_services_to_your_project*

In `android/app/build.gradle`
```gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:+"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:+"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:+"
}
```

### Issue 2 - Multiple dex files define (Again):
```gradle
:app:dexRelease
Unknown source file : UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:
Unknown source file : com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/v7/appcompat/R$anim;````
```

Solution: Upgrade your gradle to properly handle the dex tasks:

In `android/build.gradle`
```gradle
...
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'

    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
}
```

In `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
````javascript
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
````

### Issue 3 - symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 and/or OneSignal/OneSignal.h file not found

Solution: Go to your Podfile file, located within the ios folder on the root of your project.
Add the line pod 'OneSignal' as follows:
````
target 'YourApp' do
...
pod 'OneSignal', '~> 2.0'

end
````

Then head to the terminal, ls to the ios folder on the root of your project, then type `pod install` to install the pods. After that, make sure to drag `OneSignal.framework` from your Pods project on Xcode to the Frameworks folder on your Xcode workspace. Make sure that your `Link Binary With Libraries` on the `Build Phases` section of your target contains the `Onesignal.framework` file as follows.
