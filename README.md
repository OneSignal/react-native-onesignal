## Breaking Change

Make sure you read this documentation carefully, as the usage instructions had been changed since `react-native-onesignal v3.0.2`.

## Note Regarding 0.39 <= React Native >= 0.40 Support

TL;DR - Install the latest version, doesn't matter on what RN version you are.

Since version 3.0.2, this module supports backwards compatibiltiy with React Native 0.39 and below, without installing a custom version. Everyone should now update to the latest version available for this module.

## Running Example project

For your convenience, we created an example project, based on React Native 0.41.2.
You can run this project to test configurations, debug, and build upon it.

 * `git clone https://github.com/geektimecoil/react-native-onesignal`
 * `cd react-native-onesignal && cd examples && cd RNOneSignal`
 * `yarn`
 * Running the iOS example app: `react-native run-ios`
 * Running the Android example app: `react-native run-android`


## Installation
1. Add library to project
   - `yarn add react-native-onesignal`
   - OR `npm install --save react-native-onesignal`
2. Link library to project
   - `react-native link react-native-onesignal`

## Android Installation

* Follow OneSignal's instructions on generating a Google Server API Key: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key

### Adding the Code

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
.....

<!-- Optional - Add the necessary permissions (Choose one of those) -->

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/> <!-- Approximate location - If you want to use promptLocation for letting OneSignal know the user location. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/> <!--  Precise location If you want to use promptLocation for letting OneSignal know the user location. -->

<!-- End optional permissions -->

<application ....>
    <activity
        android:launchMode="singleTop"> <!-- Add this parameter -->
    .....
```

In `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
```javascript
...

distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
```

In `android/build.gradle`
```gradle
...

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.2' // Upgrade gradle

    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
}
```

In `android/app/build.gradle`

```gradle
...

android {
    ...
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.2" // NOT REQUIRED BUT RECOMMENDED - This is good for in-process dex (faster)
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        manifestPlaceholders = [onesignal_app_id: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_ID",
                                onesignal_google_project_number: "REMOTE"]
    }
}
```

## iOS Installation

### iOS Push Certificate
 * Open OneSignal account here: https://onesignal.com/
 * Follow OneSignal's instructions on generating an iOS Push Certificate: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-an-ios-push-certificate

### Add Required Capabilities
1. Select the root project and Under Capabilities Enable "Push Notifications".
2. Next Enable "Background Modes" and check "Remote notifications".
![](https://files.readme.io/VflTGOPzRDu2YmhiRgiV_Xcode%20capabilities.png)

### Adding Search Paths
1. Select your root project and go to `Build Settings`.
2. Search for `Header Search Paths`.
4. Add `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios` and set it as `recursive`.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/645861/22847689/77819cda-efa3-11e6-81c9-bb08baf9460e.png)

### Adding the Code

<details><summary>Objective-C</summary><p>

 * in `AppDelegate.h`:
   * Import `RCTOneSignal.h`:

       ```objc
       #import <RCTOneSignal.h>
       ```

   * Declare the `RCTOneSignal` property:

       ```objc
       @property (strong, nonatomic) RCTOneSignal* oneSignal;
       ```

 * in `AppDelegate.m`:

    * Synthesize `oneSignal` after `@implementation AppDelegate`

        ```objc
        @synthesize oneSignal = _oneSignal;
        ```

    * On the `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, insert the following code (replace YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID with your OneSignal app ID):

        ```objc
        self.oneSignal = [[RCTOneSignal alloc] initWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions
                                                               appId:@"YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID"];
        ```
    * You can also pass settings to OneSignal to control various effects, such as whether OneSignal automatically asks for permission to send push notifications shortly after launch or not.
        ```objc
        self.oneSignal = [[RCTOneSignal alloc] initWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions
                                                               appId:@"YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID"
                                 settings:@{kOSSettingsKeyAutoPrompt: @false}];
        ```
</p></details>

<details><summary>Swift</summary><p>

* If you don't already have one, create an Objective-C Bridging header for your project (`YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h`) and import the React-Native-Onesignal library:

```objc
#import <RCTOneSignal.h>
```
 * In your AppDelegate, add the following property:

 ```swift
var oneSignal : RCTOneSignal!
 ```

* On the `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, insert the following code (replace YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID with your OneSignal app ID):

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
    
    self.oneSignal = RCTOneSignal(launchOptions: launchOptions, appId: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
}

```

* You can also pass settings to OneSignal to control various effects, such as whether OneSignal automatically asks for permission to send push notifications shortly after launch or not.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
    
    self.oneSignal = RCTOneSignal(launchOptions: launchOptions, appId: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID", settings: [kOSSettingsKeyAutoPrompt : false])
}
```

</p></details>

### Add App Groups (Optional but Recommended)
In order for your application to be able to let push notifications increment/decrement the badge count, you need to set up an **App Group** for your application. 

Please follow [this guide](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-app-groups-setup) to set up a OneSignal app group in your app.

### Add Notification Service Extension
This step is optional but highly recommended. The `OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension` allows your application (in iOS) to receive rich notifications with images and/or buttons. If you do not follow this step, your application will not be able to show images in push notifications, and won't be able to add action buttons to notifications either.

Even if you do not have immediate plans to send push notifications containing images/action buttons, it is still recommended to follow these steps in case you ever decide to change your mind in the future. 

 * In Xcode, select `File` > `New` > `Target`
 * Select `Notification Service Extension` and press `Next`

 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsd01/react-native-onesignal/master/images/74a6d44-Xcode_create_notification_service_extension_1.png)

 * Enter the product name as `OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension` and press `Finish`

 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsd01/react-native-onesignal/master/images/1abfb4e-Xcode_create_notification_service_extension_2.png)

 * Press `Cancel` on the Activate Scheme prompt

 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsd01/react-native-onesignal/master/images/5c47cf5-Xcode_create_notification_service_extension_3.png)

_By cancelling, you are telling Xcode to continue debugging your application, instead of debugging just the extension. If you activate by accident, you can always switch back to debug your app in Xcode by selecting your application's target (next to the Play button)_

 * Go to your Project Settings and select the `OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension` target.
 * Go to `Build Settings` and search for `Header Search Paths`
 * Add `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios` and set it as `recursive`

 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsd01/react-native-onesignal/master/images/build-settings-search-paths.png)

 * With the `OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension` target still selected, select the `Build Phases` tab in Project Settings
 * In `Link Binary with Libraries`, add the following frameworks:
    - `UIKit.framework`
    - `SystemConfiguration.framework`
    - `libRCTOneSignal.a`

 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsd01/react-native-onesignal/master/images/linked-libraries.png)

 * Open `NotificationServiceExtension.m` or `NotificationService.swift` and replace the whole file contents with the code below:

<details><summary>Objective-C</summary><p>

```objc
#import <RCTOneSignalExtensionService.h>

#import "NotificationService.h"

@interface NotificationService ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) void (^contentHandler)(UNNotificationContent *contentToDeliver);
@property (nonatomic, strong) UNNotificationRequest *receivedRequest;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UNMutableNotificationContent *bestAttemptContent;

@end

@implementation NotificationService

- (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest *)request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent * _Nonnull))contentHandler {
    self.receivedRequest = request;
    self.contentHandler = contentHandler;
    self.bestAttemptContent = [request.content mutableCopy];
    
    [RCTOneSignalExtensionService didReceiveNotificationRequest:self.receivedRequest withContent:self.bestAttemptContent];
    
    // DEBUGGING: Uncomment the 2 lines below and comment out the one above to ensure this extension is excuting
    //            Note, this extension only runs when mutable-content is set
    //            Setting an attachment or action buttons automatically adds this
    // NSLog(@"Running NotificationServiceExtension");
    // self.bestAttemptContent.body = [@"[Modified] " stringByAppendingString:self.bestAttemptContent.body];
    
    self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
}

- (void)serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire {
    // Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system.
    // Use this as an opportunity to deliver your "best attempt" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used.
    
    [RCTOneSignalExtensionService serviceExtensionTimeWillExpireRequest:self.receivedRequest withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent];
    
    self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
}

@end
```
</p></details>

<details><summary>Swift</summary><p>

* Make sure to create a separate Objective-C Bridging Header for your `OneSignalNotificationExtensionService` and add the following import:

```objc
#import "RCTOneSignalExtensionService.h"
```

 * Then, replace the entire contents of `NotificationService.swift` with the following code:

```swift
import UserNotifications

class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {

    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?
    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?
    var receivedRequest : UNNotificationRequest!;

    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        self.contentHandler = contentHandler
        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)
        self.receivedRequest = request;
        
        RCTOneSignalExtensionService.didReceive(self.receivedRequest, with: self.bestAttemptContent);
        
        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
    
    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {
        // Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system.
        // Use this as an opportunity to deliver your "best attempt" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used.
        RCTOneSignalExtensionService.serviceExtensionTimeWillExpireRequest(self.receivedRequest, with: self.bestAttemptContent);
        
        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent =  bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
```
</p></details>

 _Ignore any build errors at this point, the next step will import OneSignal which will resolve any errors._

## Usage

In your `index.android.js` or `index.ios.js`:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import OneSignal from 'react-native-onesignal'; // Import package from node modules
...

export default class App extends Component {

    componentWillMount() {
        OneSignal.addEventListener('received', this.onReceived);
        OneSignal.addEventListener('opened', this.onOpened);
        OneSignal.addEventListener('ids', this.onIds);
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
        OneSignal.removeEventListener('received', this.onReceived);
        OneSignal.removeEventListener('opened', this.onOpened);
        OneSignal.removeEventListener('ids', this.onIds);
    }

    onReceived(notification) {
        console.log("Notification received: ", notification);
    }

    onOpened(openResult) {
      console.log('Message: ', openResult.notification.payload.body);
      console.log('Data: ', openResult.notification.payload.additionalData);
      console.log('isActive: ', openResult.notification.isAppInFocus);
      console.log('openResult: ', openResult);
    }

    onIds(device) {
		console.log('Device info: ', device);
    }
    ...
}

```

## API

### Handling Notifications
When any notification is opened or received the `opened` and `received` are activated and calling their callback functions defined in the listeners, passing an OSNotificationOpenResult or an OSNotification object encapsulating the event data.

```javascript
componentWillMount() {
    OneSignal.addEventListener('received', this.onReceived);
    OneSignal.addEventListener('opened', this.onOpened);
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    OneSignal.removeEventListener('received', this.onReceived);
    OneSignal.removeEventListener('opened', this.onOpened);
}

onReceived(notification) {
    console.log("Notification received: ", notification);
}

onOpened(openResult) {
    console.log('Message: ', openResult.notification.payload.body);
    console.log('Data: ', openResult.notification.payload.additionalData);
    console.log('isActive: ', openResult.notification.isAppInFocus);
    console.log('openResult: ', openResult);
}
```

Notification object received example:
```javascript
{
    shown: true, // BOOLEAN: If the notification was displayed to the user or not
    payload: {notificationID : "", contentAvailable : false, badge : 1, sound : "default", title : "Hello!", body : "World", launchURL : "", }, // OBJECT; the push data
    displayType: 1, //The display method of a received notification
    silentNotification: false // BOOLEAN : Wether the received notification was a silent one
}
```

### Sending and Getting OneSignal Tags

We exposed the tags API of OneSignal to allow you to target users with notification later.

```javascript
// Sending single tag
OneSignal.sendTag("key", "value");

// Sending multiple tags
OneSignal.sendTags({key: "value", key2: "value2"});

// Getting the tags from the server and use the received object
OneSignal.getTags((receivedTags) => {
    console.log(receivedTags);
});

// Delete a tag
OneSignal.deleteTag("key");
```

### Set Email for Better Targeting

Sync hashed email if you have a login system or collect it. Will be used to reach the user at the most optimal time of day.

```javascript
OneSignal.syncHashedEmail("test@domain.com");
```

### Using Email Features

OneSignal now allows you to send emails to your userbase. This email can be set using the OneSignal react-native SDK.

To set the email:

```javascript
let emailAuthCode = ""; //Your email auth code should be securely generated by your backend server

OneSignal.setEmail("test@test.com", emailAuthCode, {(error) => {
    //handle error if it occurred
}});
```

If you don't want to implement email auth hashing on your backend (which is heavily recommended), you can still use the OneSignal email feature in an unauthenticated state like this:

```javascript
OneSignal.setEmail("test@test.com", {(error) => {
    //handle error if it occurred
}});
```

If your application implements logout functionality, you can logout of the OneSignal email for this user using the logout function:

```javascript
OneSignal.logoutEmail({(error) => {
    //handle error if it occurred
}});
```

### Getting Player ID and Push Token

We exposed the idsAvailable API of OneSignal (both Android & iOS) as an event.
Listen for `ids` event and define a callback to handle the returned object.

```javascript
componentWillMount() {
    OneSignal.addEventListener('ids', this.onIds);
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    OneSignal.removeEventListener('ids', this.onIds);
}

onIds(device) {
    console.log('Device info: ', device);
}
```

### Enable Vibration

We exposed the enableVibrate API of OneSignal (Android only).

*You can call this from your UI from a button press for example to give your user's options for your notifications. By default OneSignal always vibrates the device when a notification is displayed unless the device is in a total silent mode. Passing false means that the device will only vibrate lightly when the device is in it's vibrate only mode.*

```javascript
// Setting enableVibrate
OneSignal.enableVibrate(true);
```

### Enable Sound

We exposed the enableSound API of OneSignal (Android only).

*You can call this from your UI from a button press for example to give your user's options for your notifications. By default OneSignal plays the system's default notification sound when the device's notification system volume is turned on. Passing false means that the device will only vibrate unless the device is set to a total silent mode.*

```javascript
// Setting enableSound
OneSignal.enableSound(true);
```

### Set In App Focus Behavior

We exposed the inFocusDisplaying API of OneSignal.

#### Both iOS and Android

 - `0` = `None`         - Will not display a notification, instead only `onNotificationReceived` will fire where you can display your own in app messages.
 - `1` = `InAppAlert`   - *(Default)* Will display an Android AlertDialog with the message contains.
 - `2` = `Notification` - Notification will display in the Notification Shade. Same as when the app is not in focus.

```javascript
// Example, always display notification in shade.
OneSignal.inFocusDisplaying(2);
```

### Change User Subscription Status

We exposed the setSubscription API of OneSignal (both Android & iOS).

*You can call this method with false to opt users out of receiving all notifications through OneSignal. You can pass true later to opt users back into notifications*

```javascript
// Setting setSubscription
OneSignal.setSubscription(true);
```


### Check Push Notification and User Subscription Status

We exposed the getPermissionSubscriptionState API of OneSignal (both Android & iOS).

*Allows you to check whether notifications are enabled for the app, whether user is subscribed to notifications through OneSignal, and what the user's in-app subscription preference is. It also provides access to pushToken and userId*

```javascript
// Check push notification and OneSignal subscription statuses
OneSignal.getPermissionSubscriptionState((status) => {
    console.log(status);
});
```

### Post Notification (Peer-to-Peer Notifications)

We exposed the postNotification API of OneSignal, currently supports one Player ID to send a notification to.
We call it internally P2P Notification, and therefore there is a special attribute to listen to while receiving the notification.

*Allows you to send notifications from user to user or schedule ones in the future to be delivered to the current device.*

The [OneSignal documentation](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-native-sdk#section--postnotification-) shows how to pass the [parameters](https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference#create-notification) as here:

```javascript
// Calling postNotification

let otherParameters = {"ios_attachments" : {"image1" : "{image_url}"}};
let data = arr // some array as payload
let contents = {
	'en': 'You got notification from user'
}
OneSignal.postNotification(contents, data, playerId, otherParameters);

// Listening to postNotification using OneSignal.Configure:
onNotificationOpened: function(message, data, isActive) {
	if (data.p2p_notification) {
		for (var num in data.p2p_notification) {
			// console.log(data.p2p_notification[num]);
		}
	}
}
```

### Prompt Location

We exposed the promptLocation API of OneSignal.

*Prompts the user for location permissions. This allows for geotagging so you can send notifications to users based on location.
Note: Make sure you also have the required location permission in your AndroidManifest.xml. For iOS, make sure you set the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription in your info.plist. (Location Always also requires the location background mode capability)*

```javascript
// Calling promptLocation
OneSignal.promptLocation();
```

### Clear Notifications (Android Only)

We exposed the clearOneSignalNotifications API of OneSignal (currently supported only on Android).

*Removes all OneSignal notifications from the Notification Shade.*

```javascript
// Calling clearOneSignalNotifications
OneSignal.clearOneSignalNotifications();
```

### Cancel Notifications (Android Only)

We exposed the cancelNotification API of OneSignal (currently supported only on Android).

*Cancels a single OneSignal notification based on its Android notification integer id. You can get the notification Id when invoking OneSignal.onNotificationOpened while receiving a notification.*

```javascript
// Calling cancelNotification
OneSignal.cancelNotification(id);
```

### Check Push Notification Permissions (iOS Only)

See what push permissions are currently enabled. callback will be invoked with a permissions object (currently supported only on iOS).

```javascript
// Requesting permissions
OneSignal.checkPermissions((permissions) => {
	console.log(permissions);
});
```

### Request Push Notification Permissions (iOS Only)

We exposed the requestPermissions method (currently supported only on iOS).

```javascript
// Setting requestPermissions
permissions = {
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true
};
OneSignal.requestPermissions(permissions);
```

### Register For Push Notifications (iOS Only)

We exposed the registerForPushNotifications API of OneSignal (currently supported only on iOS).

*Call when you want to prompt the user to accept push notifications. Only call once and only if you passed @NO to `kOSSettingsKeyAutoPrompt` on init.


```javascript
// Calling registerForPushNotifications
OneSignal.registerForPushNotifications();
```

The following example is from our own App and needs to be customized in order to work.

Example:
```javascript
_syncOneSignal = () => {
	var allTags = {};
	var missingTags = {};

	OneSignal.getTags((receivedTags) => {
		// Find missing tags
		for (var i = this.categories.length * 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			var category = this.categories[i];
			if (!(category.slug in receivedTags)) {
				missingTags[category.slug] = category.is_push_default;
			}

## FAQ / Repeating Issues
The following issues has been marked as repeating, therefore we decided to devote them a separate section.

### Issue 1 - Multiple dex files define:
```gradle
> com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/android/gms/internal/zzr;
```

Solution: Update all your Google Play Services dependencies to the latest version rather than to a specific version.

From the Google Play Services documentation:
*Be sure you update this version number each time Google Play services is updated https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup#add_google_play_services_to_your_project*

In `android/app/build.gradle`
```gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:+"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:+"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:+"
}
```

### Issue 2 - Multiple dex files define (Again):
```gradle
:app:dexRelease
Unknown source file : UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:
Unknown source file : com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/v7/appcompat/R$anim;
```

Solution: Upgrade your gradle to properly handle the dex tasks:

In `android/build.gradle`
```gradle
...
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'

    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
}
```

In `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
```javascript
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
```

### Issue 3 - symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 and/or OneSignal/OneSignal.h file not found
Please double check the [iOS Installation](#ios-installation) section as missing a step or entering an incorrect path will create these errors.

### Issue 4 - Make `react-native-onesignal` work with `react-native-maps`
If you have both `react native maps` and `react-native-onesignal` make sure you compile `react-native-maps` in the following way (android/app/build.gradle).

```gradle
compile(project(':react-native-maps')){
    exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-base'
    exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-maps'
  }
  compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:+'
  compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:+'
```

### Issue 5 - Make `react-native-onesignal` work with ExpoKit after ejecting from Expo-CRNA

If you have detached from Expo or CRNA, you might need to change the versions of Google Play Services that this library is using to make it work nicely with ExpoKit (as of SDK23). See [this issue](https://github.com/geektimecoil/react-native-onesignal/issues/301#issuecomment-327346705).

### Issue 6 - Make `react-native-onesignal` work with Redux

Please see the `examples/RNOneSignal/redux-index.js` file for example code and comments. Note that it will not compile, but instead serves as a template for how to handle Redux integration in general, and specifically including the edge case for intercepting the `onOpened` event when a User taps a push notification and prompts the app to open from a previously unopened state.

### Issue 7 - Multiple Libraries Android Errors
If you see this type of error: 

```
Error: more than one library with package name 'com.google.android.gms.license'
```

You can resolve it by adding this code to the top of your app's `build.gradle` file:

```
plugins {
    id 'com.onesignal.androidsdk.onesignal-gradle-plugin' version '0.8.1'
}
apply plugin: 'com.onesignal.androidsdk.onesignal-gradle-plugin'
```


### Manually updating iOS OneSignalNativeSDK
When you install `react-native-onesignal` it will automaticly include a specific version of the OneSignal iOS native SDK that is known to work with it. Only follow the instructions below if there is a native OneSignal SDK fix you need that isn't included already in the latest `react-native-onesignal` update.

1. Download the [latest OneSignal iOS native](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-iOS-SDK/releases) release.
2. Delete `libOneSignal.a` and `OneSignal.h` from `node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/`
3. From `/iOS_SDK/OneSignalSDK/Framework/OneSignal.framework/Versions/A/`, copy `OneSignal` to `/node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/` and rename it `libOneSignal.a`
4. Copy `OneSignal.h` from `/iOS_SDK/OneSignalSDK/Framework/OneSignal.framework/Versions/A/` to `/node_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/`
