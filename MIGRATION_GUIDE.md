# React Native v5.0.0-beta-01 Migration Guide

# Intro

In this release, we are making a significant shift from a device-centered model to a user-centered model. A user-centered model allows for more powerful omni-channel integrations within the OneSignal platform.

To facilitate this change, the `externalId` approach for identifying users is being replaced by the `login` and `logout` methods. In addition, the SDK now makes use of namespaces such as `User`, `Notifications`, and `InAppMessages` to better separate code.

This migration guide will walk you through the React Native SDK changes as a result of this shift.

# Overview

Under the user-centered model, the concept of a "player" is being replaced with three new concepts: **users**, **subscriptions**, and **aliases**.

## Users

A user is a new concept which is meant to represent your end-user. A user has zero or more subscriptions and can be uniquely identified by one or more aliases. In addition to subscriptions, a user can have **data tags** which allows for user attribution.

## Subscription

A subscription refers to the method in which an end-user can receive various communications sent by OneSignal, including push notifications, SMS, and email.  In previous versions of the OneSignal platform, each of these channels was referred to as a “player”. A subscription is in fact identical to the legacy “player” concept.  Each subscription has a **subscription_id** (previously, player_id) to uniquely identify that communication channel.

## Aliases

Aliases are a concept evolved from [external user ids](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/external-user-ids) which allows the unique identification of a user within a OneSignal application.  Aliases are a key-value pair made up of an **alias label** (the key) and an **alias id** (the value). The **alias label** can be thought of as a consistent keyword across all users, while the **alias id** is a value specific to each user for that particular label. The combined **alias label** and **alias id** provide uniqueness to successfully identify a user.

OneSignal uses a built-in **alias label** called `external_id` which supports existing use of [external user ids](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/external-user-ids). `external_id` is also used as the identification method when a user identifies themselves to the OneSignal SDK via `OneSignal.login`.  Multiple aliases can be created for each user to allow for your own application's unique identifier as well as identifiers from other integrated applications.

# Migration Guide (v3 to v5)

The React Native SDK accesses the OneSignal native iOS and Android SDKs. For this update, all SDK versions are aligning across OneSignal’s suite of client SDKs. As such, the React Native SDK is making the jump from `v3` to `v5`.

# API Changes
## Namespaces

The OneSignal SDK has been updated to be more modular in nature. The SDK has been split into namespaces, and functionality previously in the static `OneSignal` class has been moved to the appropriate namespace. The namespaces and how to access them in code are as follows:

| **Namespace** | **Access Pattern**            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Debug         | `OneSignal.Debug`         |
| InAppMessages | `OneSignal.InAppMessages` |
| Location      | `OneSignal.Location`      |
| Notifications | `OneSignal.Notifications` |
| Session       | `OneSignal.Session`       |
| User          | `OneSignal.User`          |

## Initialization

Initialization of the OneSignal SDK is now completed through the `init` method. A typical initialization now looks similar to below.

Navigate to your index.ts file, or the first Javascript file that loads with your app.

Replace the following:


```typescript
    OneSignal.setAppId("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
```

To the match the new initialization:

```typescript
    OneSignal.initialize("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
```

If your integration is **not** user-centric, there is no additional startup code required. A device-scoped user *(please see definition of “**device-scoped user**” below in Glossary)* is automatically created as part of the push subscription creation, both of which are only accessible from the current device or through the OneSignal dashboard.

If your integration is user-centric, or you want the ability to identify the user beyond the current device, the `login` method should be called to identify the user:

```typescript
    OneSignal.User.login("USER_EXTERNAL_ID");
```

The `login` method will associate the device’s push subscription to the user that can be identified via the alias `externalId=USER_EXTERNAL_ID`. If that user doesn’t already exist, it will be created. If the user does already exist, the user will be updated to own the device’s push subscription. Note that the push subscription for the device will always be transferred to the newly logged in user, as that user is the current owner of that push subscription.

Once (or if) the user is no longer identifiable in your app (i.e. they logged out), the `logout` method should be called:

```typescript
    OneSignal.User.logout();
```

Logging out has the affect of reverting to a device-scoped user, which is the new owner of the device’s push subscription.

## Subscriptions

In previous versions of the SDK, a “player” could have up to one email address and up to one phone number for SMS. In the user-centered model, a user can own the current device’s **Push Subscription** along with the ability to have **zero or more** email subscriptions and **zero or more** SMS subscriptions. Note: If a new user logs in via the `login` method, the previous user will no longer own that push subscription.

### **Push Subscription**
The current device’s push subscription can be retrieved via:

```typescript
    const id: string = await OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.getPushSubscriptionId();
    const token: string = await OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.getPushSubscriptionToken();
    const optedIn: boolean = await OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.getOptedIn();
```

### **Opting In and Out of Push Notifications**

To receive push notifications on the device, call the push subscription’s `optIn` method. If needed, this method will prompt the user for push notifications permission.

Note: For greater control over prompting for push notification permission, you may use the `OneSignal.Notifications.requestPermission` method detailed below in the API Reference.

```typescript
    OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.optIn();
```

If at any point you want the user to stop receiving push notifications on the current device (regardless of system-level permission status), you can use the push subscription to opt out:

```typescript
    OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.optOut();
```

To resume receiving of push notifications (driving the native permission prompt if permissions are not available), you can opt back in with the `optIn` method from above.

### **Email/SMS Subscriptions**

Email and/or SMS subscriptions can be added or removed via the following methods. The remove methods will result in a no-op if the specified email or SMS number does not exist on the user within the SDK, and no request will be made.

```typescript
    // Add email subscription
    OneSignal.User.addEmail("customer@company.com");
    // Remove previously added email subscription
    OneSignal.User.removeEmail("customer@company.com");
    
    // Add SMS subscription
    OneSignal.User.addSms("+15558675309");
    // Remove previously added SMS subscription
    OneSignal.User.removeSms("+15558675309");
```

## Live Activities

Live Activities are a type of interactive push notification. Apple introduced them in October 2022 to enable iOS apps to provide real-time updates to their users that are visible from the lock screen and the dynamic island.

Please refer to OneSignal’s guide on [Live Activities](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/live-activities), the [Live Activities Quickstart](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/live-activities-quickstart) tutorial, and the [existing SDK reference](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/sdk-reference#live-activities) on Live Activities.

```typescript
    // Enter a Live Activity
    OneSignal.enterLiveActivity("ACTIVITY_ID", "TOKEN", (results) => {
        console.log("Results of entering live activity");
        console.log(results);
    });
    
    // Exit a Live Activity
    OneSignal.exitLiveActivity("ACTIVITY_ID", (results) => {
        console.log("Results of exiting live activity");
        console.log(results);
    });
```

## User Namespace

The User namespace is accessible via `OneSignal.User` and provides access to user-scoped functionality.

### Push Subscription Observer

Any object implementing the `OSPushSubscriptionObserver` protocol can be added as an observer. You can call `removeObserver` to remove any existing listeners.


```typescript
// Create an observer
OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.addChangeHandler(subscription => {
  console.log('OneSignal: subscription changed: ', subscription);
});

// Removes the previously added observer
OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.removeChangeHandler();
```

```typescript
// Add a change hanlder
OneSignal.Notifications.addPermissionChangedHandler(granted => {
  console.log("OneSignal: permission state changed to: ", granted);
});

// Remove previously added handler
OneSignal.Notifications.removePermissionChangedHandler();
```

### Notification Will Show in Foreground Handler
```typescript
OneSignal.Notifications.setNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler(notificationReceivedEvent => {
    notificationReceivedEvent.complete(notificationReceivedEvent.getNotification());
});
```

### In-App Message isPaused method
```typescript
const paused = await OneSignal.InAppMessages.getPaused();
console.log("IAM paused: ", paused);
```

### In-App Message Click Handler
```typescript
OneSignal.InAppMessages.setClickHandler(result => {
  const iamClickAction = JSON.stringify(result);
  console.log('iamClickCallback: ' + iamClickAction);
});
```

### In-App Message Lifecycle Handler
```typescript
    OneSignal.InAppMessages.setLifecycleHandler({
        onWillDisplayInAppMessage: message => {
            console.log("OneSignal: will display IAM: ", message.messageId)
        },
        onDidDisplayInAppMessage: message => {
            console.log("OneSignal: did display IAM: ", message.messageId)
        },
        onWillDismissInAppMessage: message => {
            console.log("OneSignal: will dismiss IAM: ", message.messageId)
        },
        onDidDismissInAppMessage: message => {
            console.log("OneSignal: did dismiss IAM: ", message.messageId)
        }
    });
```

## Debug Namespace
The Debug namespace is accessible via `OneSignal.Debug` and provide access to debug-scoped functionality.

| **Objective-C**                                | **Description**                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OneSignal.Debug.setLogLevel(6)` | *Sets the log level the OneSignal SDK should be writing to the Xcode log.* |
| `OneSignal.Debug.setAlertLevel(0)` | *Sets the logging level to show as alert dialogs.*                                 |


# Glossary
**device-scoped user**
> An anonymous user with no aliases that cannot be retrieved except through the current device or OneSignal dashboard. On app install, the OneSignal SDK is initialized with a *device-scoped user*. A *device-scoped user* can be upgraded to an identified user by calling `OneSignal.login("USER_EXTERNAL_ID")`  to identify the user by the specified external user ID.

# Limitations
**General**
- Recommend using only in development and staging environments for Alpha releases
- Users are deleted when the last Subscription (push, email, or sms) is removed
- Any `User` namespace calls must be invoked **after** initialization. Example: `OneSignal.User.addTag("tag", "2")`

# Known issues
- Identity Verification
    - We will be introducing JWT in a follow-up Beta release
- User properties may not update correctly when Subscriptions are transferred
    - Please report any issues you find with this
